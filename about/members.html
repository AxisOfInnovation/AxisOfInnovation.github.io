I am America, but have lived internationally in Belgium and Singapore.</p></article><article><p id="articleTitle">Ilyas Sadreyev</p><p id="article">I'm a 16-year-old junior at Colleyville Heritage High School. This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> year on FIRST teams, and my first year on an FTC team. Before, I've spent two years on the Northeastern FRC team. I'm vastly interested in mechanical and electrical engineering, molecular biology, computer programming, and general mathematics. I also participate in Science Olympiad. I am Kazahkstani and attend 4 years of Russian School of Mathematics, an extracurricular school centered around mathematics, in Boston. My role on the team is, main, the mathemagician and lead engineer. Having the most experience in physics and mathematics, I apply math to system designs via physics in order to find parameters of what we can and cannot do with said system, in addition to finding the optimal, most efficient design of the system. I look forward to an exciting season, and thank you for reading.</p></article><article><p id="articleTitle">Drew DeHaven</p><p id="article">I am a 15-year-old freshman at Grapevine High School. This is my first year in FTC or any FIRST program. I am in the top level Advanced Placement classes, with very high A's and am a member of the football, basketball, and track teams. I have started my own business through the Youth Entrepreneurial Academy National Competition. I have many connections with the business world and will procure sponsorships for our team.</p></article><article><p id="articleTitle">Michelle Reitz</p><p id="article">I'm an tenth grader at Colleyville Heritage High School, and love science and mathematics above all other subjects. This is my second year doing robotics, and it has been great fun. In addition to robotics, I am highly involved in Science Olympiad, piano, Destination Imagination, and Exploravision. I love everything I do, although balancing all my activities with school work can sometimes be tiring. When I am older, I hope to become an aerospace or mechanical engineer, so I can put all of my developing engineering skills to work!</p></article><article><p id="articleTitle">T.J.
