This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> year on FIRST teams, and my first year on an FTC team. Before, I've spent two years on the Northeastern FRC team. I'm vastly interested in mechanical and electrical engineering, molecular biology, computer programming, and general mathematics. I also participate in Science Olympiad. I am Kazahkstani and attend 4 years of Russian School of Mathematics, an extracurricular school centered around mathematics, in Boston. My role on the team is, main, the mathemagician and lead engineer. Having the most experience in physics and mathematics, I apply math to system designs via physics in order to find parameters of what we can and cannot do with said system, in addition to finding the optimal, most efficient design of the system. I look forward to an exciting season, and thank you for reading.</p></article><article><p id="articleTitle">Jacob Hethcock</p><p id="article">I am a 15-year-old freshman at Grapevine High School.
