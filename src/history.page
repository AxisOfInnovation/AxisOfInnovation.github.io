We still stand by the minimal roles of coaches and mentors in the design, build, and rpogramming processes, meaning that the majority of these tasks are done solely by the members themselves, allowing for members to actually think and learn without a guiding hand, for the most part."

We did not win a single match, and our design was beyond improvement during the course of the event. Despite our awful performance on the field, we won the Connect Award for our outreach program to Mexico, which allowed us, thankfully, to continue our season and move onto the regional event at UTA."

We did end up winning a few matches; however, we did not come close to moving on without an award. Once again, we won the Connect Award for our outreach program, which, by this event, had been carried out better than we had expected, even getting the team into contact with the FLL coordinator for more help with starting a team the next season."

However, we had spent far too much time designing the wheelbase and lift and not enough on the scoop itself, which performed atrociously during the matches, while the entire rest of the robot functioned beautifully."
        p.mtmargin
            "Even though the scoop was essentially a lost cause, we never gave up on it. We improved it as much as we possibly could in between the matches; however, the best improvement came right before the final game, a locking mechanism to keep balls inside the scoop. This improvement allowed us to actually hold balls and still scoop up more without losing any of the ones we had, which led to our last match being a much needed victory."

We didn't win a single match in the entire competition, partly due to technical problems &mdash; a lack of sufficient time to program the robot correctly &mdash; and partly to construction problems, thankfully our driver did pretty well, considering these difficulties. Thankfully, though, we didn't place dead last in the entire competition."

Despite these challenges, The Axis of Innovation placed about midway in their brackets, placing about 35th out of 72 teams. Not bad for a rookie team!"
