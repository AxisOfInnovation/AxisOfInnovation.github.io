        This header file handles all infrared sensor data. This requires the file "hitechnic-irseek
        er-v2.h" to be placed in the folder named "drivers" in the same directory as Infrared.h is. 
        You may have to create the drivers folder. The file is from the 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Driver
        s which you can find by opening a sample file (under the File menu) and locating the 3rd Pa
        rty drivers directory. Your file system should reflect this to get this file to work proper

        The infrared sensor has two methods of reading input. The first one is using the direct mod
        e; however, the more usefule one is the zone method. there are five zones, for the directio
        n in which each reads in, please consult the paper shipped with your IRv2 sensor unit. This 
        file offers many ways to reduce annoyances in reading infrared values via rounding or ignor
        ing values below a certain threshold. Both of these functions are useful in filtering out a
        ny possible noise the sensor may pick up on; however, it should be noted that these alone w
        ill not filter out all noise.

        s. Each attempt will be followed by 100 milliseconds of waiting time before the next attemp
        t. Upon a tenth failure, the NXT will play the exception sound.<br/>
