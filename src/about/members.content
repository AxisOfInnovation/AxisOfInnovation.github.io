        I'm a 16-year-old junior at Colleyville Heritage High School. This is my 3<sup>rd</sup> yea
        r on FIRST teams, and my first year on an FTC team. Before, I've spent two years on the Nor
        theastern FRC team. I'm vastly interested in mechanical and electrical engineering, molecul
        ar biology, computer programming, and general mathematics. I also participate in Science Ol
        ympiad. I am Kazahkstani and attend 4 years of Russian School of Mathematics, an extracurri
        cular school centered around mathematics, in Boston. My role on the team is, main, the math
        emagician and lead engineer. Having the most experience in physics and mathematics, I apply 
        math to system designs via physics in order to find parameters of what we can and cannot do 
        with said system, in addition to finding the optimal, most efficient design of the system. 
        I look forward to an exciting season, and thank you for reading.

        I'm an tenth grader at Colleyville Heritage High School, and love science and mathematics a
        bove all other subjects. This is my second year doing robotics, and it has been great fun. 
        In addition to robotics, I am highly involved in Science Olympiad, piano, Destination Imagi
        nation, and Exploravision. I love everything I do, although balancing all my activities wit
        h school work can sometimes be tiring. When I am older, I hope to become an aerospace or me
        chanical engineer, so I can put all of my developing engineering skills to work!
