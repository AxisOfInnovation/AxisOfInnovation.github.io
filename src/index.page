            We are an FTC team, and aspiring FRC team should we get the funds to do so, out of Colleyville, Texas, since 2013
            (although many of our members are a splinter group from another, now defunct, FTC team in 2012). We have made it 
            to the Super-Regional, the third of four levels in FTC, every year since we were founded.

    <h3> Mission Statement </h3>
    <article>
        <p>
            Our goal is to offer middle and high school students an opportunity to work with robotics technology hands-on, allowing them to learn how to succeed in the world of engineering, in- and outside of the classroom. By focusing on experience through robotics competitions with other high and middle school students on other teams, we spur competition and cooperation in the design and production processes, as they would experience in the real world.

            <p>
                I'm a junior at Colleyville Heritage High School, and love science and mathematics above all other subjects. This is my third year doing robotics, and it has been great fun. In addition to robotics, I am highly involved in Science Olympiad, piano, Destination Imagination, and Exploravision. I love everything I do, although balancing all my activities with school work can sometimes be tiring. When I am older, I hope to become an aerospace or mechanical engineer, so I can put all of my developing engineering skills to work!

                I am a 16-year-old junior at Colleyville Heritage High School and this is my third year participating in FTC. I enjoy academically focused activities and am also involved in Science Olympiad, Math UIL, Explore Vision and INTERACT (The youth division of Rotary International). I help with the designing and building of the robot and am hoping to possibly aid in the programming this year. I am American, but have lived internationally in Belgium and Singapore.
