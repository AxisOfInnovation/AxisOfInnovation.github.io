        <p>
            We are a rather decorated FTC team, given how new the team is, having won awards at the Qualifying and Regional events every year for our robot designs or our outreach programs into less fortunate communities.

        <h2> Inspire Award </h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            The Insprire Award is the most prestigious award that can be received in FIRST events, ranking higher than even the first place team in the competition. This award is only granted to teams who have a well-organized notebook, detailing their design process and everything that happens on the team, a good outreach program, spreading FIRST and robotics into other communities locally or internationally, and being competitive on the playing field.

            This is the second most presitious award, following only the Inspire Award in rank. This is awarded to the teams who perform the best in the game. This is awarded only to the winning alliance's teams; however, due to how rankings work, teams lower down may move on due to their performance in the game; however, they would not receive this award.
