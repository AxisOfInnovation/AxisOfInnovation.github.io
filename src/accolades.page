This award is only granted to teams who have a well-organized notebook, detailing their design process and everything that happens on the team, a good outreach program, spreading FIRST and robotics into other communities locally or internationally, and being competitive on the playing field."

This is awarded only to the winning alliance's teams; however, due to how rankings work, teams lower down may move on due to their performance in the game; however, they would not receive this award."

We chose the team that filled in our holes the best (while we could climb and score the side climbers, they could score cubes during the regular game) which also happened to be the second place team. Together, we easily beat all of our opponents in the semifinals and finals matches, scoring 234 points in our first match together, even with technical difficulties with our Alliance's robot."

This is extremely useful in back-to-back matches when time is an issue and the value of this was seen by the judges."
